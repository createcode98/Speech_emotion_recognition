Speech Emotion Recognition

Abstract

Speech Emotion Recognition is the act of attempting to recognize human emotion and affective states from speech. This is capitalizing on the fact that voice often reflects underlying emotion through tone and pitch. In human machine interface application, emotion recognition from the speech signal has been research topic since many years. To identify the emotions from the speech signal, many systems have been developed. In this project, Convolutional Neural Networks have been used. Here emotion recognition is done for different emotions like neutral, happy, sad, anger, disgust, surprise and fear.
The Speech Emotion Recognition Model takes input of various audio and based on it, predicts the emotion of the speaker along with the gender. This involves the application of Machine Learning algorithms and methods.

Educational Goals

Further this project can be taken to the next level to detect suicidal tendencies in teenagers as well as adults. The success rate is around 75 % but can be increased further.  This technology can help a lot of people save their loved ones. Issues can be tracked which includes the accuracy of this project and can also be improved. This project can keep a track of a person’s mood and can predict if the person has a mental depression or not. In the pandemic, several people tried to end their lives due to the hard times. Speech-emotion recognition can help understand the mental state of these people. 
 
Design

 The algorithm for Speech Emotion Recognition follows the following:
1. Import the necessary libraries
2. Load the datasets
3. Pre-processing and analyzing the datasets
4. Saving the datasets into a csv file i.e., merging the datasets
5. Splitting the data into train and test data
6. Normalize the data
7. Train the model

Libraries used in python

KERAS: It’s a high-level network API, for fast experimentation

SKLEARN: Machine Learning Library

LIBROSA: for music and audio analysis

JSON: can be used to work with the JSON data

NUMPY: for supporting large multi-dimensional arrays

PANDAS: for data analysis

GLOB: to easily retrieve file names of same kind

TENSORFLOW: for numerical computations

MATPLOTLIB: for visualizations

The two projects I liked and Would like to work on if got a chance:

1.	ImportA

I've always wanted to build something like a website. The idea of buying and selling in general sounds profitable. Also, nowadays everything from small push pins to large beds, everything is ordered online because it is a lot cheaper and delivered pretty fast. I work at staples and in this pandemic, we have lots of products that are not available in the store and as a result we help customers buy it online. Selling furniture is also a profitable deal because having a home office nowadays is very common.
I can make contribution in making the search bar better, because personally when I try to find things online, I do not know the proper name of the product but still try and find it with keywords. It is very frustrating when we cannot find what we want to and as a result we switch to another website. How we can implement this is when a customer searches anything we can show them different items that match their searching needs and when they select one item from the list, we can show them similar items to that. For example, is a customer searches for lamps, we can show them all lamps which have different description to each other like one is bedside, the other can be novelty lamps, or study table lamps, or lava lamps and them when the customer chooses one from that, we can show them similar lamps to what they chose. In my view, this could enhance the customer experience.


2.	Calculator App

Enhancing an already existing simple calculator is a good idea. It would help students find their answers very much quicker. When I took a Calculus class, I tried to find many calculators which showed all the steps and the method that they use to find answers but could not find a calculator that shows everything for free. We could team up and build this existing simple calculator and try to be as much detailed as we can in providing steps of whatever calculations that our calculator does. Also, providing these features for free would help a lot of students. Later to enhance we could let the users sign up for using our calculator and develop it into an app.
I do have many functions that we can add in the simple calculator. Some of them can be simple to complex algebra, because algebra is something which most of the students struggle with. We can also add functions that would calculate sine, cosine, cosecant, secant, tangent and cotangent functions which would sum up trigonometry. For adding a difficulty level, we could also add integration and differentiation into the calculator. As per me, I can be a help in writing these functions because I think I've been a good math student. Also, bringing this calculator as an app on the phone would help lots and lots of students as well as teachers. Testing this calculator would be a very difficult job!

Persona:

For the speech recognition app, the user can be psychologists. If I were a psychologist, I would take some help of the speech recognition app and record the voice of the patient over the course of the day I he/she is at home and see what happens to her speech or tone in different situations. It can also be used in comparing the tone of the patient from the first visit to the ending visits. If I were a parent, I would use this app to monitor my child’s behavior. Try to understand all the moods of the child so that the consequences of the generation gap can be reduced.
